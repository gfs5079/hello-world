# hello-world

Hello,

My name is Geoff and I'm a sophmore at Penn State University majoring in Information Sciences and Technology (IST: Design and Development Option) and Security Risk and Analysis (SRA: Information and Cyber Security Option).  I am passionate about technology and want to improves my knowledge and skills in and out of the classroom.  I look forward to see what I can learn during the next couple years.
